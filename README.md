# Voyage — A Long Journey 🛰️

**Voyage** is a CLI-based motion simulator built in C++ using a self-designed general physics engine library.

Designed as both a **learning project** and a **simulation framework**, Voyage turns classical equations of motion into an interactive experience where physics is explored through gameplay and experimentation.

## 🚀 About the Project

The project introduces a reusable physics engine (`engine.h`) intended to be flexible for multiple simulation or game implementations.

Key ideas behind Voyage:

- Tick-based time simulation
- Euler integration for continuous motion updates
- High-precision logging
- Real-time CLI visualization of motion behaviour
- Gamified interaction with physics concepts

Voyage can be used as:

- 🎮 A physics-based simulation game  
- 📚 An educational tool for motion mechanics  
- 🧩 A foundation for future simulation projects
